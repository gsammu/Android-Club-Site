          MMU Android Student Club is a club founded to gather Android learners in one place - a positive environment for the eager-learners to conduct discussions, help each other out as well as keeping each other accountable of their learning progress.
  
          Every Friday of 2014/15 Trimester 3, members will gather and code together. There will be sharing sessions which allow club members to share what they have learned, relevant and irrelevant to Android. 
  
          Finally, we will have a demo session. Just like how students would present their FYP.

        h3.text-center What Android Student Club Isn't

        markdown:

          This club is **not a workshop**. There will not be a lecturer/trainer talking in front, and you doze off at the back.
          
          Instead, you are very autonomous in your learning. You will be given a set of tasks that need to be completed for each week, and be expected to complete them before the next club meetup.
          
          If you have bumped into problems, or you have question marks in your head when doing the tasks, bring it to the meetup and don't be afraid to ask. *(And hopefully got answer lah.)*

            It's **free** to join Android Student Club. However, members are expected to:

            - To commit and willing to invest time and effort into learning Android development at unprecedented pace
            - To help foster a positive and safe environment for people to learn together
            - To be helpful to other club members as well as non-members
            - To be friendly towards beginners, people of other races and gender
            - *and other social rules as mentioned in [Hacker School User Manual](https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sec-environment)*

            Of course, we would love you to know:

            - Java, or is sufficiently-good with similar OOP languages such as C++
            - Googling effectively, because most of the time you will have to solve problems by Googling the solution
